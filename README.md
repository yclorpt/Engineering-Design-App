# Engineering-Design-App
### 2024 TSA Engineering Design Competition
The goal for this year's competition is to make something to "Advance Health Informatics" 

Our idea is to create an AI chat robot that hospitals and other health-related institutions can use to better connect with patients. A large problem in today's society is when people are hurt they don't fully grasp just how hurt they are. From children to adults, it is difficult to weigh between a simple check-up with your doctor to a visit to the emergency room. Our chatbot is made to recognize these differences so a patient can know whether they need to stay home, or their health provider needs to be informed.

The chatbot will be a mobile application that interfaces with Google's Dialogflow AI to generate responses.

### Working Build:
- Flutter
    - To work on a large range of devices, Flutter is being used for its cross platform services.
- News Section
    - This section is to keep people better informed on diseases and other important health information. It's important to have this information because the only news that is shared about general health is usually only highly important, eg. COVID-19, and other highly documented illnesses. 
- Chat Section
    - This section is to help people cope through illness. Certain things in life aren't as detrimental as we may think they are and the availability of doctors is not 24/7. Many times people may have small issues and by trying to simply search for these problems online, they may get worried by seeing they have illnesses that they may not have (self diagnosis). The chatbot's purpose is to prevent this by giving simple health advice on how to deal with common symptoms. The bot is planned to prompt you to contact your doctor when it is clear that your symptoms are much more grave than you may seem.
- Coming Soon! Profile
    - To keep track of developing symptoms, or to have easy contact with your doctor, a profile would hold this data. This brings up issues of data privacy and data integrity, so we find it would be best to hold a trial run of this feature rather than have it be a feature off the bat. 

### Results: 
- 1st Place Colorado State TSA
