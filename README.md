###2024 TSA Engineering Design Competition
The goal for this years competition is to make something to "Advance Health Informatics" 

Our idea is to create and AI chat robot that hospitals and other health related instituitions can use to better connect with patients. A large problem in today's society is when people are hurt they don't fully grasp just how hurt they are. From children to adults it is difficult to weigh between a simple check up with your doctor to a visit to the emergency room. Our chatbot is made to recognize this differences so a patient can know whether they need to stay home, or their health provider needs to be informed.
