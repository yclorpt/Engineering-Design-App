# Engineering-Design-App
### 2024 TSA Engineering Design Competition
The goal for this year's competition is to make something to "Advance Health Informatics" 

Our idea is to create an AI chat robot that hospitals and other health-related institutions can use to better connect with patients. A large problem in today's society is when people are hurt they don't fully grasp just how hurt they are. From children to adults, it is difficult to weigh between a simple check-up with your doctor to a visit to the emergency room. Our chatbot is made to recognize these differences so a patient can know whether they need to stay home, or their health provider needs to be informed.

The chatbot will be a mobile application that interfaces with Google's Dialogflow AI to generate responses.
