      title: 'A high-protein diet and elevation in the amino acid leucine may contribute to buildup of plaque in arteries',
      subtitle: 'In a recent study published in Nature Metabolism, researchers conducted clinical studies on murine animals and humans to evaluate the impact of high protein intake on the amino acid-mammalian target of the rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) autophagy signaling pathway. They also assessed the dose-response relationship, downstream effects, and amino acid specificity of mTORC1 activation.',
      body: 'Background:\n     Animal studies have reported high protein intake associated with cardiovascular disease in Western nations. High-protein diets enhance atherogenesis through amino-acid-mediated mTORC1 signaling and impair autophagy and mitophagy in macrophages. The specific articular processes underlying this activation remain unknown, although the authors speculate that the stimulatory impact may be related to certain ''pathogenic'' amino acids.\n\nAbout the Study:\n     In the present study, researchers conducted two clinical experiments to investigate the dose-response connection between dietary protein consumption and the amino acid specificity of the amino acid-mTOR-autophagy pathway in human monocytes or macrophages.\nThe first experiment examined protein consumption extremes by assessing the impact of fluid meals containing 50% or 10% protein content on mTORC1 pathway activation in monocytes. The second experiment used a more realistic setting, assessing these results in subjects who received standard protein meals or mixed meals with more protein (15% kilocalories vs. 22% kilocalories). The study analyzed monocytes expressing cluster of differentiation 14 (CD14+) but not CD16 since they represent most monocytes in circulation and are most likely to develop into atherosclerotic macrophages.\nThe team performed flow cytometry and monocyte isolation from platelets. They used western blotting, fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS), and immunofluorescence to investigate the impact of different protein content meals on serological amino acid levels, monocyte mTORC1 signaling, and downstream consequences.\nThe team investigated 14 overweight individuals [based on body mass index (BMI)] twice following a 12-hour overnight fast. The participants consumed low- and very high-level protein meals. The researchers used cultured human monocyte-derived macrophages to investigate the macrophage-specific mTORC1 response to amino acids and to assess dosage effects.\nThey measured amino acid concentrations in plasma and macrophages using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and quantified the arginine amounts in plasma using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. They determined the size of atherosclerotic lesions using Oil Red O staining of aortic root slices.\nThe researchers investigated whether leucine-dependent mTORC1 activation occurs in vivo in mice and cultured murine macrophages. ApoE knockout mice were fed six meals over eight weeks, including a moderate-protein western diet, a high-protein western diet, a moderate-protein western diet with leucine and amino acids, more amino acids, and a nitrogen-adjusted version of moderate-protein plus amino acids.\nThey investigated whether serum amino acids were present in C57BL/6J mice weaned at three weeks old. In vivo, atherosclerosis-related investigations began at eight weeks using male mice of the given genotype fed varied diets.\n\nResults:\n     The study identified leucine as the primary activator of mTOR signaling in macrophages, showing a threshold impact of consuming protein in large quantities and circulating leucine on monocytes or macrophages. Only protein above 25g per meal activates mTOR and has functional consequences. Ingestion of proteins above 22% of dietary energy needs triggers the harmful amino acid-mTORC1-autophagy signaling pathway in human monocytes and macrophages, which causes atherosclerosis in male mice. The study found a strong link between high protein consumption and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk, indicating the possibility for diet advice and treatment measures.\nThe total amino acid content in plasma increased after having the high-protein liquid meal but not after drinking the low-protein one. During the three-hour postprandial interval, consuming the very high protein level boosted mTORC1 signaling and gradually reduced LC3 signal intensity, indicating mTORC1-mediated autophagy suppression. Western blot analysis showed a robust dose-dependent impact of leucine-mediated mTORC1 activation in HMDMs, as evaluated by phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6 and ribosomal protein S6 kinase (p-S6K).\nThe team also found a dose-dependent threshold effect for mTOR-LAMP2 colocalization, suppression of autophagy (diminished LC3 puncta formation), and mitophagy (reduced colocalization of the mitochondrial marker COXIV with the autophagosome marker LC3). They observed significantly increased levels of four amino acids (Leu, Ile, Val, and Thr) in mice following protein gavage compared to control gavage.\nLeucine was the most effective mTORC1 activator, with 1.6 g of protein per kg of gavage resulting in higher mTORC1 activation than 0.8 g of protein per kg of gavage. The study revealed that increased dietary leucine is both required and sufficient to produce the pro-atherogenic impact of a high-protein diet in vivo.\nThe study findings showed that high protein consumption, notably through elevated plasma leucine, might suppress mTORC1-mediated autophagy and atherogenesis in monocytes and macrophages, with critical clinical and public health implications.\nAlthough higher protein consumption than the recommended allowance of 0.8 grams/kg/day is regarded safe, the study suggests caution and more clinical studies. Leucine was the primary amino acid responsible for activating mTOR in macrophages, and increasing protein consumption had a threshold effect on the detrimental signaling pathway.\nA comprehensive examination is required to determine the accurate threshold between dietary protein benefits and negative health impacts.',

      title: 'Study suggests high levels of vitamin B3 breakdown products are linked to higher risk of mortality, heart attacks, and stroke',
      subtitle: 'In a recent study published in Nature Medicine, researchers utilized an untargeted metabolomics technique to look for new compounds and pathways that may contribute to residual cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk.',
      body: 'Background:\n     CVD is a worldwide health problem, with only a tiny proportion of the risk linked to known risk factors. Despite breakthroughs in therapeutics, the risk of CVD remains high, indicating the presence of other unidentified variables.\n\nNiacin, an essential vitamin in dietary staples, is critical in CVD. Treatment groups had mean LDL levels <50 mg/dl but significant cardiovascular event rates. Individuals with high inflammatory markers have an increased chance of developing CVD. However, dietary niacin intake has increased due to the increasing consumption of processed and fast food, raising concerns regarding the efficiency of therapeutic niacin in lowering CVD risk.\n\nAbout the study:\n     In the present study, researchers used untargeted mass spectrometry technology to identify circulating small molecules that predict incident CVD event risks without established risk factors.\n\nThe researchers investigated clinical, genetic, and mechanistic links between the terminal breakdown products of excess niacin and the incidence of major adverse cardiac events (MACE). They conducted untargeted metabolomics analyses on fasting plasma from stable cardiac patients in a prospective discovery cohort and subjects with elective diagnostic cardiac examinations.\n\nThe researchers postulated that the putative MACE-related analyte with m/z values of 153 Da may be a combination of two co-eluted structural isomers: the N1-methyl-2-pyridone-5-carboxamide (or 2PY) metabolite and the N1-methyl-4-pyridone-3-carboxamide (or 4PY) metabolite. They chemically synthesized both metabolite standards and conducted several chemical characterization tests.\n\nThe team used stable-isotope-dilution liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) to examine the relationship between structural isomer levels in circulation and new-onset major-type adverse cardiovascular event risk in two validation populations [United States (US) cohort of 2,331 individuals and the European cohort of 832 individuals]. They performed a sensitivity analysis on validation cohort data to account for confounding with known risk variables.\n\nThe researchers used a genome-wide association study (GWAS) approach and meta-analyses to investigate the genetic determinants of circulating 2PY and 4PY levels. They combined the study results from the United States validation cohort with publicly available summary statistics for 2PY and 4PY levels from various multi-ancestry datasets. They reduced Acmsd expression in vivo by injecting mice with a liver-tropic adeno-associated virus (AAV) expressing either a short hairpin RNA (shRNA) targeting Acmsd or a scrambled control shRNA to directly test the notion that ACMSD influences 2PY and 4PY levels.\n\nThe researchers also used Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to determine if genetically higher 2PY and 4PY levels were causally associated with CVD outcomes. They conducted in vitro and in vivo functional studies to investigate whether 2PY or 4PY would induce VCAM-1 expression on endothelial cells. They used in vivo methods to investigate the immediate effects of 2PY or 4PY on arterial VCAM-1 expression and function.\n\nResults:\n\n     Niacin metabolites were associated with an increase in major adverse CVD events (MACEs). Chemical production of authentic 2PY and 4PY standards and additional chemical characterization tests demonstrated that the MACE-associated blood ''analyte'' with m/z values of 153 Da was a combination of the co-eluting structural isomers 2PY and 4PY with the same elemental composition.\n\nIn the US and European validation cohorts, serological 2PY and 4PY levels showed associations with increased three-year major-type adverse cardiovascular event risk [adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) for 2PY of 1.6 and 2.0, respectively; and for the 4PY metabolite: 1.9 and 2.0, respectively). Elevated 4PY levels were still strongly related to the incidence of major-type adverse cardiovascular event risk in both persons with relatively maintained and compromised renal function.\n\nA phenome-level association study of the rs10496731 genetic variant, strongly correlated with both metabolite levels, found a link to soluble-type vascular adhesion molecule 1 (sVCAM-1). A meta-analysis found a link between rs10496731 and sVCAM-1 in 106,000 individuals, including 53,075 women. The validation group (974 individuals, 333 females) showed a significant correlation between sVCAM-1 expression and the niacin metabolites.\n\n4PY metabolite (but not 2PY) administration in physiological amounts increased VCAM-1 expression and leukocyte adhesion to the vascular endothelial cells in murine animals. Both niacin metabolites were related to residual cardiovascular disease risk. The team also proposed an inflammation-dependent mechanism for the clinical connection between the 4PY metabolite and major adverse CVD events.\n\nThe study findings showed that two terminal metabolites of niacin and NAD metabolism, 2PY and 4PY, are associated with CVD regardless of established risk factors. Both metabolites genetically link to vascular inflammation, with a gene variation strongly associated with circulating 2PY and 4PY levels and sVCAM-1 levels. Excess niacin, particularly 4PY, is linked to increased MACE risks and may contribute to residual cardiovascular disease risk via inflammatory pathways. Further research is required to improve understanding of these relationships.',

      title: 'Is a Digital Detox the Answer to Technostress?',
      subtitle: 'In the current digital era, an increase in the use of technology in both personal and professional settings has led to the development of many clinical conditions, such as anxiety and depression. A higher use of smartphones that support multiple applications, including social networking sites, contributes to the generation of stress. Digital detox intervention focuses on alleviating the negative effects of technology.',
      body: 'What is technostress?:\n\nThe continual increase in the use of information technology has a great impact on society. Individuals associated with multiple professions are exposed to digital devices during the majority of their working hours. In addition, digital entertainment applications capture a significant amount of their leisure time. The practice is a common phenomenon across the world. Many studies have indicated that overt use of information technology leads to technostress, which is defined as “stress or psychosomatic illness caused by working with computer technology on a daily basis.”.\n\nThe ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has significantly increased remote work arrangements. The remote working opportunities have helped many individuals to be more productive with less time spent on commuting.3 However, remote working has simultaneously increased the use of information technology, which in turn has increased the risk of developing technostress\n\nSmartphones have become an integral part of modern society. The increase in the use of smartphones has both positive and negative consequences. This device allows the user to make phone calls, send and receive emails/text messages, capture videos/photos, surf websites, navigate to a destination, and access social media networks. Therefore, smartphones provide multiple features that have wide-ranging applications, i.e., from communication to obtaining information whenever required.\n\nDespite all the positive utility of smartphones, it is a major factor that adversely affects mental health. High smartphone usage has been associated with the development of depression, anxiety, and a digital fear of missing out, which is popularly known as “FOMO.” Furthermore, it also reduces self-esteem and promotes unhealthy life practices, such as poor sleep, decreased physical activities, eating disorders, and increased sedentary behavior.\n\nParticularly among the younger generation, some social media applications, such as Instagram, Facebook, and TikTok, installed on smartphones consume a significant amount of user’s time. In comparison to all applications available to smartphone users, social media applications cause several adverse consequences, leading to overall poor life satisfaction.\n\nCan a digital detox counteract technostress?:\n\nThe term “digital detox” was first introduced in 2012, that describes the “period of time during which a person refrains from using their electronic devices, such as smartphones, regarded as an opportunity to reduce stress or focus on social interaction in the physical world”. Other terms, such as media diet” and “digital diet” revolve around the concept of digital detox.\n\nTo counteract the effect of technostress, many “digital detox” interventions have come into the limelight. As described above, digital detox intervention is associated with self-imposed inhibitions from using electronic devices, such as smartphones. This intervention could be a complete timeout of electronic devices or inhibiting the use of specific applications in smartphones. Put simply, digital detox is associated with periodic disconnection or reduction in information technology engagements.\n\nMultiple studies have published contradictory effectiveness of digital detox interventions regarding the improvement of the well-being of an individual. Despite this ambiguity, a majority of the general public assumes that keeping away from information technology would improve mental well-being. ',

      title: 'Study identifies factors driving home care workers to quit their jobs',
      subtitle: 'Many of Finland''s newly established wellbeing services counties are looking to cut costs in eldercare services, especially in round-the-clock care and home care. At the same time, the sector suffers from a significant shortage of workforce, which means that a growing number of older adults, many with high needs for support, have to manage in their own homes without adequate help. According to a new study by the University of Eastern Finland, difficulties in home care have persisted for a long time - and also taken a toll on home care workers'' wellbeing.',
      body: 'According to the researchers, home care workers should be seen as professionals who want to take responsibility for their work and be involved in the development of their field. Home care workers expect increasingly personal management and better consideration of the needs of the employee and the client alike. There is also a need to discuss the values associated with the work. This requires the development of indicators for home care, as a mere focus on care procedures is not enough to meet older adults' 'needs. In addition, interaction and encounters between clients and home care workers should also be prioritised.\n\nThe study examined home care workers'' reasons for leaving their jobs from the perspective of reforms in public services and eldercare policies impacted by New Public Management (NPM) in Finland. Gaining in popularity since the 1990s, NPM has sought to rationalise eldercare services by developing management and relying on market-oriented thinking.\n\n"We observed that the principles of New Public Management were clearly reflected in home care workers'' experiences and reasons for leaving their jobs. Decisions on eldercare taken at the national level and solutions made within organisations were reflected on the day-to-day work of home care workers even to such an extent that caused them to leave their jobs,'" Ring explains.\n\nThe study was conducted as part of the SOLDEX project, which examined old-age social exclusion especially from the perspective of older home care clients.\n\n"'A significant proportion of those receiving regular home care live alone or with an older spouse, and they need a lot of support due to, e.g., physical or cognitive decline. We know that older home care clients have a high risk for social exclusion if the services provided at home are not adequate. The situation is thus extremely concerning also from the perspective of those needing home care,'" says Associate Professor Elisa Tiilikainen of the University of Eastern Finland.\n\nThe study was funded by the Finnish Work Environment Fund and the Research Council of Finland.'",

      title: 'Husker research duo selected as Phase 1 winners in the NIH''s Targeted Genome Editor Delivery Challenge',
      subtitle: 'A Husker research duo was named a first-round winner in a National Institutes of Health competition aimed at generating solutions for delivering genome-editing technology to the cells of people with rare and common diseases.',
      body: 'Janos Zempleni, Willa Cather Professor of molecular nutrition, and Jiantao Guo, professor of chemistry, were selected as Phase 1 winners in the NIHs Targeted Genome Editor Delivery Challenge. The challenge is a three-phase competition with prizes totaling 6 million; the University of Nebraska–Lincoln team was among 30 initial recipients announced in December 2023.\n\nWith the 25,000 prize, Zempleni and Guo will advance development of universal milk exosomes -; natural nanoparticles contained in milk -; capable of transporting gene editors to any location in the body.\n\nThese programmable exosomes would be safe, scalable and, unlike conventional nanoparticles, capable of evading macrophages, the immune system cells that destroy foreign substances. \n\nWith our technology, you could treat basically any disease known to mankind, both rare and common, said Zempleni, who is leading the project and directs the Nebraska Center for the Prevention of Obesity Diseases through Dietary Molecules. Federal agencies are not overly eager to invest in treatment of rare diseases because it costs a lot of money, yet only a few people benefit.\n\nWith the flexibility of our technology, we can, without extra cost, provide a platform to treat everything, from common diseases like brain cancer, to very rare gene mutations that maybe affect only 500 people in the United States.\n\nThe technology would overcome one of the most significant challenges to using gene editing to treat disease. Though tools like CRISPR-cas9 can delete, repair or replace disease-causing DNA -; which could halt tumor growth in cancer or shut down production of harmful proteins -; there is currently no reliable means of guaranteeing an editor will reach whichever organ or tissues are associated with a certain disease. And, when gene editors do reach the intended target, they often do not survive in sufficient numbers to change the course of the disease. \n\nThe Husker teams solution combines Zemplenis nationally recognized expertise in milk exosomes with Guos extensive skills in the growing field of bioorthogonal chemistry. Based on his previous research, Zempleni knew it was possible to load milk exosomes with therapeutics and deploy them to a specific tissue in the body. Hes also demonstrated the exosomes biological safety, meaning theyre unlikely to cause adverse reactions in patients. \n\nBut his tools lacked versatility: He needed a method for directing the exosomes to different locations depending on the disease at hand.\n\nTo accomplish this, Zempleni developed an approach that allows him to attach three peptides -; short amino acid chains -; to the membrane of each exosome. One is a homing peptide, which directs the exosome to bind to a specific site in the body. Another is a do not eat me peptide, which sends biochemical signals that allow the exosome to thwart macrophage destruction. The last is what is called a retrofusion peptide, which fortifies the exosomes survivability once it enters the target cells.\n\nUsing the three peptides in concert is novel, Zempleni said, and preliminary data indicate the approach is feasible. But what iss even more innovative is the teams approach for anchoring the peptides to the exosome membrane. Conventional approaches insert lipid anchors into the membrane, then attach the peptide modifiers to those anchors. The problem is that those lipids are attracted to other lipophilic compounds in the body, leading to detachment and loss of the attached peptide.\n\nThe Nebraska teams approach overcomes this problem by creating docking sites in a membrane protein called CD81, which is firmly rooted in the exosome, preventing detachment. Guo is using bioorthogonal chemistry approaches to create stable, covalent links between the docking sites and the peptides. He said this attachment scheme confers stability and uniformity to the exosome structure, boosting the commercial viability of milk exosome-based therapeutics.\n\nIf this were to go to clinical trials, it will be easier for the FDA to see that this is a defined, homogenous structure, rather than random labeling that would lead to batch-to-batch differences, said Guo, who leads the Nebraska Center for Integrated Biomolecular Communication.\n\nZempleni and Guo are also attaching a polyhistidine tag to the exosomes, which allows them to be purified at a low cost and a high purity. The tag is easily removable in case it causes adverse reactions in patients.\n\nPackaging the milk exosomes with CRISPR-cas9 cargo and other therapeutics is one of Zemplenis longer-term goals. Eventually -; possibly with support from additional funding through the TARGETED Challenge -; he aims to partner with a transgenic livestock expert at Utah State University to develop a goat or cow that, through its milk, secretes massive numbers of programmable exosomes containing gene-editing cargo and the peptide docking sites.\n\nFor this Phase 1 project, he will load cultured MAC-T cells, which closely mirror cow milk cells, with gene-editing tools using previously established genetics and chemistry approaches.\n\nZempleni and Guos designer exosomes are already showing commercial potential. At the end of 2023, the team was notified they would receive a patent titled Extracellular Vesicles and Methods of Using. They have licensed the inventions in that patent to a private company, which is partnering with Roche, Inc., to use bovine milk exosome technology to deliver RNA therapeutics to brain tumors.\n\nThe researchers are preparing their application for the TARGETED Challenge Phase 2, which will award up to 10 winners 250,000 and eligibility to compete in Phase 3. NIH will announce Phase 2 winners in April 2025.',
